<div style="text-align: justify;">
I'm a second-year Master's student at the [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/) advised by Professor [Maria L. Pacheco](https://blast-cu.github.io/mlpacheco/) in the [BLAST Lab](https://blast-cu.github.io/). I'm broadly interested in Natural Language Processing, with a focus on interpretable AI and structured reasoning systems. My current research involves developing explainable AI systems using entailment trees for multi-step reasoning in question-answering tasks.

## Personal Research Interests

In parallel, I'm working under Professor [Theodora Chaspari](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/theodora-chaspari) on detecting and mitigating bias and fairness issues in Large Language Models within the mental health domainâ€”a project that stems from my personal interest in ensuring AI systems are equitable and beneficial across diverse populations. This work combines my core interests in NLR with my commitment to responsible AI development.

## Research Interests

My research interests span Natural Language Processing, with particular focus on Natural Language Understanding, Natural Language Reasoning, neurosymbolic systems, interpretable and explainable AI systems, fairness and bias mitigation in NLP, AI for Good, and applications of NLP in interdisciplinary domains.

**I'm actively seeking opportunities in Natural Language Processing and related areas.**

Feel free to contact me for research collaborations or other engagements.
